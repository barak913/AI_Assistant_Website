# A Tutorial for Building and Deploying a Web Application Platform for Experiments with Conversational AI

The tutorial introduces free open-source code, with detailed step-by-step instructions including the installation of the code, the deployment of the web application, and data cleaning suggestions. The open-source code is accompanied by detailed instructions and recommendations for adjustments to researchers' needs and preferences.

Throughout the code files, researchers can look for relevant change suggestions (e.g., instructions presented to participants) by searching for `CONFIG YOU WILL EDIT` comments. These comments were written to allow optional user-friendly customization.

Note that, although accessing the code is completely free to use, the code requires AI API keys and deployment on AWS, which may incur usage costs. For pricing, see the relevant sections and the official API website and AWS for more details.

The README file offers a step-by-step instructions that are divided into four main steps:

# <code>_Step 1: Installation and Local Setup_</code>

The first step is to have all the needed applications downloaded to your computer, in order to be able to run the platform locally and easily make later changes.

# <code>_Step 1.1: Installation Required Applications_</code>

# Download GitHub

To set up your computer, you need to download git on your laptop.

Please use this link to download git: https://git-scm.com/install/ (you can keep the default settings).

Next, log in into your account using the github downloaded on your laptop.

# Download This Repository

After you download github, to save this code and get it ready to edit, follow these steps:

1. Click **Fork** (top-right on GitHub, next to watch) to create your own copy of this repository.
2. Open your Command Prompt - CMD (write "cmd" in your computer search).
3. Go to the folder where you want to save the code using the following command:

   ```
   cd PATH/TO/FOLDER
   ```

4. Clone **your fork** to your computer:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/AI_Assistant_Website.git
   ```

5. Move into project folder using:

   ```
   cd AI_Assistant_Website
   ```

6. Add the original repository as upstream (so you can pull updates later), using the following commands:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/atilmansour/AI_Assistant_Website
   git remote -v
   ```

7. Make sure your branch is main using the following:

   ```
   git checkout main
   git status
   ```

   Now you are free to start editing and saving your changes locally and in github:

8. Next, open the local repository in your preferred IDE (for exmaple, using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). Throughout the code, you can look for relevant change suggestions by searching **CONFIG YOU WILL EDIT**. To search for this term across files, you can click `Ctrl+shift+f`. Now, you can make a small change just to test that your changes are being saved.

9. Save your changes, by saving the file, and push them to your fork:

   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your change"
   git push
   ```

   Note that, for the first use, git may ask you to identify your information. To do that, run:

   ```
   git config --global user.email "YOUR_GIT_EMAIL@EMAIL.COM"
   ```

# Download Node JS

First, make sure Node.js is downloaded (you can install the windows installer). This will allow you to locally test your code and make sure it looks as you expect it to look.

You can download it from the following website: https://nodejs.org/en/download

You may need to close and reopen your cmd and code folder that you are working on. To make sure Node JS is downloaded, run:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

# <code>_Step 1.2: Local Setup and Environment Variables_</code>

# Backend Folder (API and Environment Variables)

This project includes a `backend/` folder that runs a small server (proxy) for:

1. Calling AI providers (ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini) securely.
2. Handling AWS actions (e.g., S3) securely.

**Why do we need a backend?**

- API keys and AWS secret keys must NOT be stored in the React frontend (they become public after deployment).
- Some providers also block browser requests due to CORS.
- The backend keeps secrets server-side and returns only the needed data to the frontend.

### Backend environment variables

Create `backend/.env` file (name the file `.env` and put it in the `backend` folder) and add your secrets there.

- In this file you will need to write 6 rows, just like this:
  ```
  REACT_APP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=Your secret key
  REACT_APP_ACCESS_KEY_ID= Your key
  REACT_APP_BucketS3=Your s3 bucket name
  OPENAI_KEY=Your GPT key
  CLAUDE_KEY=Your claude key
  GEMINI_KEY=Your gemini key
  ```
- Depending on which LLM you will use, you will need to generate a key. Please note models' abilities and pricing.

  Note that if you want to use only some of the following LLMs, you can leave the key empty.
  For example, if you only want to use ChatGPT as your LLM, you can write `GEMINI_KEY=''` and `CLAUDE_KEY=''`:
  1. To generate ChatGPT key: `OPENAI_KEY=Bearer XXXX`

     Go to [OpenAI API's official website](https://openai.com/api/). You will need to create an account, and get a personal key. It is important to keep this key private, as this is what allows you to connect to ChatGPT.

  2. To generate Claude key: `CLAUDE_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...`

     Go to [Claude API's official website](https://claude.com/platform/api). You will need to create an account, and get a personal key. It is important to keep this key private, as this is what allows you to connect to Claude.

  3. To generate Gemini key: `GEMINI_KEY=AIzaSy...`

     Go to [Gemini API's official website](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key). You will need to create an account, and get a personal key. It is important to keep this key private, as this is what allows you to connect to Gemini.

- For the other environment keys, you can keep them empty for now, we will get back to them when we deploy the platform to AWS in [Amazon Web Services (AWS) section](<#Amazon_Web_Services_(AWS)>).
- **Make sure `backend/.env` is in `.gitignore`** (in your local code) before you push your code again to github. To do that, you need to have a line that says `backend/.env` inside your .gitignore file.

- **_backend/server.js_**: Calls ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini securely (API keys stay private). Here, you can change model names and max tokens here.

  > You may change the components of each AI's API: The default is max_tokens = 1000, and the following models: gpt-4o (ChatGPT), 2.5-flash (Gemini), 4 sonnet (Claude). You may adjust these to your liking.

  > You can find more information about each AI's models on their official API website, and choose the model that best fits your needs.

# <code>_Step 2: Preparing your Experimental Conditions_</code>

# <code>_Step 2.1: Choose your experimental conditions according to your research goals_</code>

Now it's time for you to define your goal, and follow the instructions below to find the experimental conditions that suit your goals. The platform allows you to choose between five experimental conditions. Here, we provide the summary table which includes the example research goals and corresponding experimental conditions. For the full examples, please check out our paper.

# <code>_Step 2.2 Details regarding each experimental condition_ </code>

Now that you defined your goal, and decided on the conditions you will use for your experiment. Time to learn more in depth about each of the experimental conditions.

The following presents all five experimental conditions the platform offers in more detail, and instructions on how to duplicate conditions. Note that all conditions are located in the `src/pages` folder:

> Note, In the Always Visible AI, Toggleable AI, and Participant-Initiated AI conditions, researchers can turn on and off the option to copy and paste from the conversational AI to the text editor and vice versa according to researchers' goals.
>
> Moreover, researchers can change the LLM powering the conversational AI to ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude to compare different LLMs.
>
> Finally, in all conditions, there are thresholds for the amount of words written in the text editor or time spent on the platform, which are customizable.

1. **Always Visible AI Condition**:
   - **_Purpose_**: This condition includes a text editor and conversational AI interface. The condition allows researchers to test the effects of constantly having the option to use conversational AI.
   - **_Differences from other conditions_**: Compared to the participant-initiated condition, here, the conversational AI automatically appears after a set number of seconds (default is 100 milliseconds = appearing upon page load). Compared to the toggleable-AI condition, here, participants cannot close and reopen the conversational AI interface.
   - **_Route Suffix_**: Add `/u` to the base link of the platform, can be adjusted in `Routes.js` file, located in the pages folder.
   - **_Default participant-code_**: A default prefix of "AVA" and a suffix of U.

2. **Toggleable AI Condition**:
   - **_Purpose_**: This condition includes a text editor and a toggleable conversational AI interface, meaning that participants can close and reopen the conversational AI. The condition allows researchers to test the effects of having the option to close and reopen the conversational AI.
   - **_Differences from other conditions_**: Compared to the Always Visible AI condition, in which the AI is constantly visible, here, participants can close and reopen that conversational AI. Compared to the participant-initiated condition, in which the conversational AI opens after participants press a button, here, the conversational AI interface opens after a set number of seconds.
   - **_Route Suffix_**: Add `/o` to the base link of the platform, can be adjusted in `Routes.js` file, located in the pages folder.
   - **_Default participant-code_**: A default prefix of "TA" and a suffix of O.
3. **Participant-Initiated AI Condition**:
   - **_Purpose_**: This condition includes a text editor and a conversational AI interface, where the conversational AI appears only if participants choose to activate it themselves, by pressing a button in the text editor's toolbar.
   - **_Differences from other conditions_**: Compared to the Always Visible AI condition, participants can close and reopen the conversational AI interface. Compared to both Always Visible AI and Toggleable AI conditions, in which the conversational AI automatically opens after a set number of seconds, here, participants must actively press a button in order to activate it.
   - **_Route Suffix_**: Add `/b` to the base link of the platform, can be adjusted in `Routes.js` file, located in the pages folder.
   - **_Default participant-code_**: A default prefix of "PI" and a suffix of B.

4. **No AI Condition**:
   - **_Purpose_**: This condition includes only a text editor. It allows researchers to test a setting in which participants do not have access to conversational AI, and it can serve as a control condition for comparison with all other AI-available conditions.
   - **_Route Suffix_**: Add `/c` to the base link of the platform, can be adjusted in `Routes.js` file, located in the pages folder.
   - **_Default participant-code_**: A default prefix of "NA" and a suffix of C.

5. **Conversational AI Only Condition**:
   - **_Purpose_**: This condition includes only a conversational AI interface. It allows researchers to examine how users interact with conversational AI and to study writing produced entirely through AI. It can also be added to experiments when researchers want greater control over the instructions or background information given to the LLM, as well as an easy way to record all messages exchanged between participants and the conversational AI.
   - **_Differences from other conditions_**: Compared to the No AI condition, in which participants need to rely entirely on themselves for writing, here, participants need to interact with the conversational AI.
   - **_Route Suffix_**: Add `/a` to the base link of the platform, can be adjusted in `Routes.js` file, located in the pages folder.
   - **_Default participant-code_**: A default prefix of "OA" and a suffix of A.

**Creating new conditions**:

- **_Purpose_**: allowing researchers to test research goals 6-10 specified in Table 1, which require duplicating a condition.
- **_How to duplicate_**:
  1. Create a new JavaScript file (.js file) by pressing the 'new file' button.
  2. Copy-paste the original condition's content into the new one.
  3. Change the name of the condition by going to the last line 'export default NAME' and changing all the appearances of the name to fit your new condition (press 'Ctrl+F' to find all the appearances of the condition's name).
  4. Create a specific path to the new condition, access the `Routes.js` file, which is located in the `src/pages` folder. In the `Routes.js` file, add an import line (import NAME from "./JS_FILE_NAME";), and a Route path, as instructed in the file's comments.

# <code>_Step 2.3: Editing your experimental conditions_</code>

After you decided on your research goal and got more familiar with the experimental conditions you will use. It is time to edit them!

For relevant change suggestions only, search **`CONFIG YOU WILL EDIT`** (press `Ctrl+F`) to find out about all appearances of the required or recommended adjustments in the experiemntal file.

We remind you that if you want to view all possible adjustments you can press `Shift+Ctrl+F` to search for `CONFIG YOU WILL EDIT` across files.

Moreover, make sure you are working with the LLM version you like, as specified earlier in step 1.2.

## App.css

App.css is the main file that controls how the app looks (colors, spacing, fonts, layout). Therefore, if you needed to change anything regarding the _style_ of the page, you will need to change the elements in `App.css`:

To preview and debug style changes, open **Chrome DevTools**:

- **Windows/Linux:** press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`
- **Mac:** press `Cmd + Option + I`
- Or: **Right-click** anywhere on the page → **Inspect**

Then click the **Elements** tab, select an element on the page, and you’ll see the CSS rules (including from `App.css`) on the right side.

# <code>_Step 3: Local Testing and Deployment_</code>

# <code>_Step 3.1: Local testing to make sure your conditions look as you expect them to look_</code>

- It is now time to test the platform locally and make sure it appears as expected. Even after running the code locally (as described below), you can continue making changes, save them, and the local version will update automatically, allowing you to view your changes in real time..

- Open **two terminals** (one for the backend, one for the frontend):
  - To open a terminal, you can click on View, New Terminal.
  - Make sure to use **git bash** as your terminals (you can change the terminal using the arrow next to the plus after you open the terminal).

### Terminal 1 (Backend)

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### Terminal 2 (frontend)

```
cd AI_Assistant_Website
npm install
npm start
```

The app should open in your browser (usually at http://localhost:3000). To access your conditions, you add to your website line `/x` depending on the wording you chose in `Routes.js` file.

To stop the local code from running, press `Ctrl+C`.

> `npm install` is needed the first time you set up the project (or any time `package.json` changes).  
> After that, you can run only `cd XXX` depending on the terminal, and `npm start`.

# <code>_Step 3.2: Deployment to AWS so your experiment is ready to run._</code>

## Upload your code (ready-to-run): Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Now that your experiment is ready to run, it is time to deploy it! For this step, you need to have an AWS account. Note that, the deployment of the web application may incur usage costs.

# <code>_Step 3.3: Download your submissions_</code>

1. To download your submissions, you can access your S3 bucket and download each file.txt alone.
2. To bulk download your submissions, follow the next steps:

   **Create an IAM user for CLI**
   1. AWS Console → IAM
   2. Left menu → Users → Create user
   3. Username: cli-downloader (or anything)
   4. Permissions: choose Attach policies directly, create policy, JSON, and paste the content of `s3_policy_download.json` → create policy. Choose your policy and press next, then create user.
   5. Click on your IAM new user name you just created, on security credentials, and create access key. Please select **Command Line Interface CLI**. Copy both the **access key** and **secret access** key and save them in a private place.

3. **Install AWS CLI** using the following [**link**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

4. **In your CMD**

   ```
   aws configure (will ask you to include your keys, and region)
   aws s3 sync s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME "PATH/TO/Local/Folder"
   ```

# <code>_Step 4: Data Cleaning._</code>

The following code is written in python, in case you do not have python installed, please install it from [the official Python page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

We provide in the `CodeAnalysisData` folder:

- **_getPlainTexts.py_**: A code that receives the .txt folder path, and extracts the last version of the text (as a plain text) for usage. Please read the comments in the code, as you can also merge the texts with your data according to the codes/texts' names.
- **_getMessageInCSV.py_**: A code that receives the .txt folder path, and extracts the messages between the chatbot and user (as a csv file) for usage. The csv file includes a timestamp column, a sender column, and a message content column.

That's it! Please feel free to contact me atil@campus.technion.ac.il or atilxmansour@gmail.com for any questions.
